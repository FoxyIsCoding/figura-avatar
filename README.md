# Instalation
The instalation is simple. You need to own a **Minecraft account** (and no a cracked version will not work in this case)               
Then you need a Minecraft launcher but the Mojang one should be fine too :3  
The figura mod requires a mod loader like fabric. Depending on the version of the minecraft you play you have to install the **figura mod**; I'ma not explain more here as there are a lot of great mod installation guide and instead ima just jump to adding the avatar to figura

To install the avatar you have to open your Minecraft instance folder and inside of that find a folder called **figura/avatars**  inside that clone the repo or download the .zip folder.. that's all :3

now if you load up figura you can select the avatar in the wardrobe
